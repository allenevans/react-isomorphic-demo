react isomorphic demo
=====================
A very basic isomorphic react application demo for a presentation with a hand rolled routing and flux implementation.

* Install node dependencies.
    `npm install`

* Install client side dependencies
    `bower install`

* Use gulp to build the project
    `gulp`

* Run the build server.
    `node /build/server/server.js`

* Launch web browser
    `http://localhost:3434/`
    
    
Caveats
-------
* This node.js + react app was built purely to understand the basics needed to compose an entire isomorphic single page application using react.

* Most of the code has been thrown together at great speed to meet the deadlines of the presentation it was required for.

* Most likely only works on Mac and unix based systems.
